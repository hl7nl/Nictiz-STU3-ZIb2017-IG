","NameInformation","Health professional’s full name. If a health professional identification number is entered, it will be the name as listed in UZI, AGB or by the healthcare center.","Dutch names require that certain name parts are separately communicable. For this reason, extensions are added onto the base HumanName element to mark the meaning of each part. A Dutch HumanName is still a proper FHIR HumanName; however, there might be an incompatibilty with the default FHIR mechanism for communicating given names. See the compatibility note below for more information.

The extension elements cover birth name (NL: eigennaam / geslachtsnaam) and partner/spouse name. Both may have a prefix (NL: voorvoegsel). When a person marries, he or she may keep their own name, assume the partner name, append the partner name to their own name, or the other way around.

**Incompatibility note**: It has come to light that this specification deviates from the way that the HumanName datatype is normally used. This will be fixed in a future release. However, current implementations should be aware of the special considerations regarding the use of this specification. 

The issue at hand is the way alternative representations of a name, like initials or a nickname, are communicated. Normally this is done using multiple HumanName instances, which are differentiated using the `.use` element. However, this specification allows for including all alternative representations in the _same_ HumanName instance, with the expectation that the extensions provide enough information for recieving systems to differentiate them. However, this means that contrary to the normal usage of this datatype, repetitions of `.given` names cannot be concatenated to get the full list of given names; the list might be a mix of full names, nicknames and initials.

Since multiple implementations are based on this specification, sending systems are advised (but not required) to keep the approach with one HumanName instance, while recieving systems should be able to handle this one-instance approach. More specifically:

* Sending and recieving systems SHOULD always use the specified extensions when using this datatype.
* Sending systems are encouraged to populate the `.text` element to unambigiously communicate the patient name.
* Sending systems are encouraged to send either the full given names or the initials, but not both. This alleviates the duplication of names in `.given`.
* When a sending system uses the current one-instance approach for communicating multiple representations, `.use` MAY NOT be populated. After all, it is not possible to select a single `.use` when the instance contains different representations.
* When a recieving system interprets the instance as the single-instance-multiple-representations approach, the `.given` names marked as initials SHOULD be interpreted as alternatives to the full given names. Note the underlying HCIM expects both the _list_ of full names and _list_ of initials to be a single string; there's no match for an initial to a full name. The instance SHOULD be regarded as using this approach when:
  * They encounter a single instance
  * And the `.use` element is absent
  * And all the name parts are differentiated using the specified extensions
* In any other circumstance, recieving systems SHOULD interpret the usage as the normal use.

Example: miss Irma Jongeneel marries mister de Haas and assumes the name Irma Jongeneel-de Haas:

* `.family` = ""Jongeneel-de Haas""
* `.given` = ""Irma"" (with `.given:iso21090EnQualifier` = _BR_)
* `.family:humannameOwnName` = ""Jongeneel""
* `.family:humannamePartnerPrefix` = ""de ""

","AddressInformation","There is a variety of postal address formats defined around the world. This format defines a superset that is the basis for all addresses around the world and adds all relevant components to express Dutch addresses.

A Dutch Address is a proper FHIR Address. Systems that do not understand any of the extensions, will be able to render and work with a Dutch address. Dutch addresses make certain address parts separately communicable. These parts are required for use in true Dutch systems when dealing with Dutch addresses, but may not have value for international systems when information gets sent abroad.

To have true compatibility an implementer SHOULD use the core Address parts as intended. To have addresses work for Dutch context, the implementer SHOULD in addition use the extension elements.

The HCIM defines certain address types in the AdresSoortCodelijst. These do not all have a one to one mapping in the FHIR Address datatype. The following explains how to deal with that. In addition, there are the ConceptMaps http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressUse and http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressType to define this relationship

HCIM Postal Address maps to Address.type 'postal'; 

HCIM Primary Home Address maps to Address.extension:official 'true' + Address.use 'home' + Address.use.extension 'HP'; 

HCIM Visit Address (Woon-/verblijfadres) maps to Address.use 'home' + Address.type 'physical' + Address.use.extension 'PHYS'; 

HCIM Temporary Address maps to Address.use 'temp'; 

HCIM Work Place Address maps to Address.use 'work';  

HCIM Vacation Home Address maps to Address.use 'temp' + Address.use.extension 'HV'.

If Address.type is ""both"" then this is to be understood as a dual purpose address (postal and physical). Systems that support importing it like this are encouraged to do so, otherwise they may need to import this as two separate addresses.","Note: address is for postal addresses, not physical locations.","The home/mailing address of the practitioner is often required for employee administration purposes, and also for some rostering services where the start point (practitioners home) can be used in calculations.","","","","","<valueAddress xmlns=""http://hl7.org/fhir"">
