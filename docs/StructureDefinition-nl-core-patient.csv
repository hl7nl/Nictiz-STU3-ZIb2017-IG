","NameInformation","A human's name with the ability to identify parts and usage.","Dutch names require that certain name parts are separately communicable. For this reason, extensions are added onto the base HumanName element to mark the meaning of each part. A Dutch HumanName is still a proper FHIR HumanName; however, there might be an incompatibilty with the default FHIR mechanism for communicating given names. See the compatibility note below for more information.

The extension elements cover birth name (NL: eigennaam / geslachtsnaam) and partner/spouse name. Both may have a prefix (NL: voorvoegsel). When a person marries, he or she may keep their own name, assume the partner name, append the partner name to their own name, or the other way around.

**Incompatibility note**: It has come to light that this specification deviates from the way that the HumanName datatype is normally used. This will be fixed in a future release. However, current implementations should be aware of the special considerations regarding the use of this specification. 

The issue at hand is the way alternative representations of a name, like initials or a nickname, are communicated. Normally this is done using multiple HumanName instances, which are differentiated using the `.use` element. However, this specification allows for including all alternative representations in the _same_ HumanName instance, with the expectation that the extensions provide enough information for recieving systems to differentiate them. However, this means that contrary to the normal usage of this datatype, repetitions of `.given` names cannot be concatenated to get the full list of given names; the list might be a mix of full names, nicknames and initials.

Since multiple implementations are based on this specification, sending systems are advised (but not required) to keep the approach with one HumanName instance, while recieving systems should be able to handle this one-instance approach. More specifically:

* Sending and recieving systems SHOULD always use the specified extensions when using this datatype.
* Sending systems are encouraged to populate the `.text` element to unambigiously communicate the patient name.
* Sending systems are encouraged to send either the full given names or the initials, but not both. This alleviates the duplication of names in `.given`.
* When a sending system uses the current one-instance approach for communicating multiple representations, `.use` MAY NOT be populated. After all, it is not possible to select a single `.use` when the instance contains different representations.
* When a recieving system interprets the instance as the single-instance-multiple-representations approach, the `.given` names marked as initials SHOULD be interpreted as alternatives to the full given names. Note the underlying HCIM expects both the _list_ of full names and _list_ of initials to be a single string; there's no match for an initial to a full name. The instance SHOULD be regarded as using this approach when:
  * They encounter a single instance
  * And the `.use` element is absent
  * And all the name parts are differentiated using the specified extensions
* In any other circumstance, recieving systems SHOULD interpret the usage as the normal use.

Example: miss Irma Jongeneel marries mister de Haas and assumes the name Irma Jongeneel-de Haas:

* `.family` = ""Jongeneel-de Haas""
* `.given` = ""Irma"" (with `.given:iso21090EnQualifier` = _BR_)
* `.family:humannameOwnName` = ""Jongeneel""
* `.family:humannamePartnerPrefix` = ""de ""
* `.family:humannamePartnerName` = ""Haas""","Need to be able to track the patient by multiple names. Examples are your official name and a partner name.","","","","","<valueHumanName xmlns=""http://hl7.org/fhir"">

","AddressInformation","There is a variety of postal address formats defined around the world. This format defines a superset that is the basis for all addresses around the world and adds all relevant components to express Dutch addresses.

A Dutch Address is a proper FHIR Address. Systems that do not understand any of the extensions, will be able to render and work with a Dutch address. Dutch addresses make certain address parts separately communicable. These parts are required for use in true Dutch systems when dealing with Dutch addresses, but may not have value for international systems when information gets sent abroad.

To have true compatibility an implementer SHOULD use the core Address parts as intended. To have addresses work for Dutch context, the implementer SHOULD in addition use the extension elements.

The HCIM defines certain address types in the AdresSoortCodelijst. These do not all have a one to one mapping in the FHIR Address datatype. The following explains how to deal with that. In addition, there are the ConceptMaps http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressUse and http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressType to define this relationship

HCIM Postal Address maps to Address.type 'postal'; 

HCIM Primary Home Address maps to Address.extension:official 'true' + Address.use 'home' + Address.use.extension 'HP'; 

HCIM Visit Address (Woon-/verblijfadres) maps to Address.use 'home' + Address.type 'physical' + Address.use.extension 'PHYS'; 

HCIM Temporary Address maps to Address.use 'temp'; 

HCIM Work Place Address maps to Address.use 'work';  

HCIM Vacation Home Address maps to Address.use 'temp' + Address.use.extension 'HV'.

If Address.type is ""both"" then this is to be understood as a dual purpose address (postal and physical). Systems that support importing it like this are encouraged to do so, otherwise they may need to import this as two separate addresses.","Note: address is for postal addresses, not physical locations.","May need to keep track of patient addresses for contacting, billing or reporting requirements and also to help with identification.","","","","","<valueAddress xmlns=""http://hl7.org/fhir"">

","NameInformation","A human's name with the ability to identify parts and usage.","Dutch names require that certain name parts are separately communicable. For this reason, extensions are added onto the base HumanName element to mark the meaning of each part. A Dutch HumanName is still a proper FHIR HumanName; however, there might be an incompatibilty with the default FHIR mechanism for communicating given names. See the compatibility note below for more information.

The extension elements cover birth name (NL: eigennaam / geslachtsnaam) and partner/spouse name. Both may have a prefix (NL: voorvoegsel). When a person marries, he or she may keep their own name, assume the partner name, append the partner name to their own name, or the other way around.

**Incompatibility note**: It has come to light that this specification deviates from the way that the HumanName datatype is normally used. This will be fixed in a future release. However, current implementations should be aware of the special considerations regarding the use of this specification. 

The issue at hand is the way alternative representations of a name, like initials or a nickname, are communicated. Normally this is done using multiple HumanName instances, which are differentiated using the `.use` element. However, this specification allows for including all alternative representations in the _same_ HumanName instance, with the expectation that the extensions provide enough information for recieving systems to differentiate them. However, this means that contrary to the normal usage of this datatype, repetitions of `.given` names cannot be concatenated to get the full list of given names; the list might be a mix of full names, nicknames and initials.

Since multiple implementations are based on this specification, sending systems are advised (but not required) to keep the approach with one HumanName instance, while recieving systems should be able to handle this one-instance approach. More specifically:

* Sending and recieving systems SHOULD always use the specified extensions when using this datatype.
* Sending systems are encouraged to populate the `.text` element to unambigiously communicate the patient name.
* Sending systems are encouraged to send either the full given names or the initials, but not both. This alleviates the duplication of names in `.given`.
* When a sending system uses the current one-instance approach for communicating multiple representations, `.use` MAY NOT be populated. After all, it is not possible to select a single `.use` when the instance contains different representations.
* When a recieving system interprets the instance as the single-instance-multiple-representations approach, the `.given` names marked as initials SHOULD be interpreted as alternatives to the full given names. Note the underlying HCIM expects both the _list_ of full names and _list_ of initials to be a single string; there's no match for an initial to a full name. The instance SHOULD be regarded as using this approach when:
  * They encounter a single instance
  * And the `.use` element is absent
  * And all the name parts are differentiated using the specified extensions
* In any other circumstance, recieving systems SHOULD interpret the usage as the normal use.

Example: miss Irma Jongeneel marries mister de Haas and assumes the name Irma Jongeneel-de Haas:

* `.family` = ""Jongeneel-de Haas""
* `.given` = ""Irma"" (with `.given:iso21090EnQualifier` = _BR_)
* `.family:humannameOwnName` = ""Jongeneel""
* `.family:humannamePartnerPrefix` = ""de ""
* `.family:humannamePartnerName` = ""Haas""","Contact persons need to be identified by name, but it is uncommon to need details about multiple other names for that contact person.","","","","","<valueHumanName xmlns=""http://hl7.org/fhir"">

","AddressInformation","There is a variety of postal address formats defined around the world. This format defines a superset that is the basis for all addresses around the world and adds all relevant components to express Dutch addresses.

A Dutch Address is a proper FHIR Address. Systems that do not understand any of the extensions, will be able to render and work with a Dutch address. Dutch addresses make certain address parts separately communicable. These parts are required for use in true Dutch systems when dealing with Dutch addresses, but may not have value for international systems when information gets sent abroad.

To have true compatibility an implementer SHOULD use the core Address parts as intended. To have addresses work for Dutch context, the implementer SHOULD in addition use the extension elements.

The HCIM defines certain address types in the AdresSoortCodelijst. These do not all have a one to one mapping in the FHIR Address datatype. The following explains how to deal with that. In addition, there are the ConceptMaps http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressUse and http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressType to define this relationship

HCIM Postal Address maps to Address.type 'postal'; 

HCIM Primary Home Address maps to Address.extension:official 'true' + Address.use 'home' + Address.use.extension 'HP'; 

HCIM Visit Address (Woon-/verblijfadres) maps to Address.use 'home' + Address.type 'physical' + Address.use.extension 'PHYS'; 

HCIM Temporary Address maps to Address.use 'temp'; 

HCIM Work Place Address maps to Address.use 'work';  

HCIM Vacation Home Address maps to Address.use 'temp' + Address.use.extension 'HV'.

If Address.type is ""both"" then this is to be understood as a dual purpose address (postal and physical). Systems that support importing it like this are encouraged to do so, otherwise they may need to import this as two separate addresses.","Note: address is for postal addresses, not physical locations.","Need to keep track where the contact person can be contacted per postal mail or visited.","","","","","<valueAddress xmlns=""http://hl7.org/fhir"">

","Literal reference, Relative, internal or absolute URL","A reference to a location at which the other resource is found. The reference may be a relative reference, in which case it is relative to the service base URL, or an absolute URL that resolves to the location where the resource is found. The reference may be version specific or not. If the reference is not to a FHIR RESTful server, then it should be assumed to be version specific. Internal fragment references (start with '#') refer to contained resources.","Using absolute URLs provides a stable scalable approach suitable for a cloud/web context, while using relative/logical references provides a flexible approach suitable for use when trading across closed eco-system boundaries.   Absolute URLs do not need to point to a FHIR RESTful server, though this is the preferred approach. If the URL conforms to the structure ""/[type]/[id]"" then it should be assumed that the reference is to a FHIR RESTful server.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Reference.reference",0,1,"ref-1

","Logical reference, when literal reference is not known","An identifier for the other resource. This is used when there is no way to reference the other resource directly, either because the entity is not available through a FHIR server, or because there is no way for the author of the resource to convert a known identifier to an actual location. There is no requirement that a Reference.identifier point to something that is actually exposed as a FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept that would be expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.","When an identifier is provided in place of a reference, any system processing the reference will only be able to resolve the identifier to a reference if it understands the business context in which the identifier is used. Sometimes this is global (e.g. a national identifier) but often it is not. For this reason, none of the useful mechanisms described for working with references (e.g. chaining, includes) are possible, nor should servers be expected to be able resolve the reference. Servers may accept an identifier based reference untouched, resolve it, and/or reject it - see CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicy. 

When both an identifier and a literal reference are provided, the literal reference is preferred. Applications processing the resource are allowed - but not required - to check that the identifier matches the literal reference

Applications converting a logical reference to a literal reference may choose to leave the logical reference present, or remove it.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Reference.identifier",0,1,"","",".identifier"
